		HADOOP
		######
-> Hadoop is Open-source framework, that allows to store and process big data in a 
   distributed environment across clusters of computers.

-> It is used to store process and analyze data which are very huge in valume.
-> Hadoop is distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers.

	Architecture
	############
-> It fallows Master-slave architecture.
-> Allows parallel processing of data.

	Advantages
	##########
-> Easy to use
-> Scalable
-> cost-effective
-> Improved performance
-> Highly availble

types of Hadoop
===============
1) HDFS
2) MapReduce

1) HDFS is derived from the GFS(Googal File System) in 2002.

2) MapReduce is derived from GMR(Googal Map Reduce) in 2004 .

-> File system -> File system is layear it act between software and hardware(read and write data from one to the hard disk).
Ex: NTFS, EXT, HDFS, S3..

-> block -> it distributed the 1GB of Data into small blocks.

Types distributed system
1) master-slave
2) pear to pear

-> Spark is a Data processing technologies which will do both batch processing, Stream processing and analytic.
-> Programming Language use are Scal, Java, Python, R.
-> Linux, sql, prg lang
-> Demon prosess - master, worker
-> Deploment modes
   -> Standalone(only one spark)
   -> YARN 
   -> meosos
-> In memory processing
-> spark Ripple
   -> spark shell(scala)
   -> pyspark
-> Spark API
   -> RDD
   -> Data frame
   -> Data set
-> transformation, action((map, short , group),(count, show))
