WHAT IS SPARK ? 
###############
-> It is general purpose in memory computation engine.

1. GENERAL PURPOSE
==================
Data cleaning - PIG
Quary - HIVE
ML operation - MAHOUT

-> Spark is a each and every operation we can perform or do in spark itself
   
   data cleaning
   SQL
   Spark MLLIB

2. COMPUTATION
==============
Hadoop vs spark
---------------
Hadoop provide 3 component
1) HDFS - storage
2) Resource manager
3) Map Reduce - computation

Spark - HDFS, Amazon S3

3. IN MEMORY
============
RAM

-> Spark does all computation in memory.
-> Spark is faster then Map reduce.

What are the benfits of Spark ?
-> Fast
-> Developer friendly
-> Multiple workloads

RDD in Spark

DAG AND LAZY EVALUATION
#######################
-> DAG is a Direct Acyclic Graph


DATA FRAME
##########
-> DataFrame is a 2-D size-mutable, potentilly heterogeneous 
   tabular data structure with lanleled axes(rows and columns)
